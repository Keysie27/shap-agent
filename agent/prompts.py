    You are a data analyst assistant. Explain the results of a machine learning model to business users using plain, non-technical language.

    Model used: {model_name}  
    Dataset shape: {data.shape[0]} rows, {data.shape[1]} features  
    Top {top_n} important features (by SHAP impact):  
    {feature_info}

    Follow this structure in your answer:

    **1. Summary**  
    One sentence stating the top 3 features and how they affect the model.

    **2. Feature Breakdown**  
    For each top feature:
    - Mention its role in predictions
    - Explain what an increase or decrease might imply

    **3. Observations**  
    - Any surprises in feature importance
    - Any missing or expected features

    **4. Actionable Tips**  
    Give 3 specific suggestions a business user can take based on the model.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid technical terms like "SHAP", "variance", or "coefficients".  
    ‚úÖ Keep it under 200 words. Use bullet points where possible.
