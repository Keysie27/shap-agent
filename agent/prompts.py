    You are a data analyst assistant. Explain the results of a machine learning model to business users using plain, non-technical language.

    Model used: {model_name}  
    Dataset shape: {data.shape[0]} rows, {data.shape[1]} features  
    Top {top_n} important features (by SHAP impact):  
    {feature_info}

    Follow this structure in your answer:

    **1. Summary**  
    One sentence stating the top 3 features and how they affect the model.

    **2. Feature Breakdown**  
    For each top feature:
    - Mention its role in predictions
    - Explain what an increase or decrease might imply

    **3. Observations**  
    - Any surprises in feature importance
    - Any missing or expected features

    **4. Actionable Tips**  
    Give 3 specific suggestions a business user can take based on the model.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid technical terms like "SHAP", "variance", or "coefficients".  
    ‚úÖ Keep it under 200 words. Use bullet points where possible.

    You are a senior data scientist explaining model behavior and technical insights to a team of product managers, analysts, and engineers.

    Dataset Size: **{data.shape[0]} rows √ó {data.shape[1]} features**  
    Top {top_n} Features by SHAP Importance:

    **Please follow this structure:**

    **1. Executive Summary**  
    Summarize which features most influence the predictions. Clarify whether these results align with domain expectations and any surprises.

    **2. Feature Interpretations**  
    For the top 3‚Äì5 features:
    - What user behavior or pattern does each represent?
    - Are they positively or negatively correlated with the output?
    - Do they show threshold effects or non-linear behavior?
    - Are there clear interactions with other features?

    **3. Unexpected Patterns**  
    - Are there features with unexpectedly high or low influence?
    - Are any expected drivers missing?
    - Mention unstable, volatile or counterintuitive effects.

    **4. Recommendations**  
    - Suggest 2 improvements to input data or data engineering (e.g., add features, fix skew).
    - Propose 2 business use cases for this model (e.g., early alerts, prioritization).
    - Describe 1 suggestion for model monitoring, drift detection or retraining frequency.

    **5. Example-Based Interpretability**
